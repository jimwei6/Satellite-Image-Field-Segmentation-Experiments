# Field Area Segmentation

This project is for solafune's Field Area Segmentation contest (https://solafune.com/competitions/d91572d9-1680-4b9e-b372-25e71093f81a?menu=about&tab=overview).

We took two different approaches:
- Using Mask R-CNN to predict fields and get the resulting polygon (Best)
- Using UNET to perform pixel-wise prediction, predicting the boundary of fields

Coming up:
- Treating it as a problem to detect lines and junctions
